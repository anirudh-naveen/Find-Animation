# Find-Animation - WIP
Application where users can filter, find, rate, and track all the animated television shows and films they have watched.

This site follows the MEVN stack architecture:
 - MongoDB
 - Express.js
 - Vue.js
 - Node.js

The application also utilizes the Tmdb, MyAnimeList, and Google Gemini APIs in its functionality.
